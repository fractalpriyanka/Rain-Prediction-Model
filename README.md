## Weather Forecast using Machine Learning
Weather Forecast ML model play a crucial role in enhancing our ability to predict and respond to weather conditions, leading to pimproved safety, efficiency, and sustainability in varous sectors.


## Ah, weather forecasting!!
"the only profession where you can be wrong half the time and still keep your job! It's like a magical art form where every forecast is a bold prediction, yet the accuracy rivals that of a coin toss. I mean, who wouldn’t love planning their beach day around a forecast of sunny skies, only to end up experiencing a surprise monsoon? At this point, I’m convinced the weather app should come with a disclaimer: “Predictions are based on pure guesswork and wild speculation.”
